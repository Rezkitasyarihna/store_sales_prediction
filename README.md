# store_sales_prediction
Forecasts are especially relevant to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, which must dance delicately with how much inventory to buy. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leading to lost revenue and upset customers. More accurate forecasting, thanks to machine learning, could help ensure retailers please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time.

Current subjective forecasting methods for retail have little data to back them up and are unlikely to be automated. The problem becomes even more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever-transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing.

Data that's currently being used here is data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, that was obtained from an open-source Kaggle. There are 7 datas in the store-sales-time-series-forecasting.zip, such as:
1. train.csv
2. test.csv
3. sample_submission.csv
4. stores.csv
5. oil.csv
6. holiday_events.csv
7. transactions.csv
