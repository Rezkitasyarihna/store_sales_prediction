Forecasts are especially relevant to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, which must dance delicately with how much inventory to buy. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leading to lost revenue and upset customers. More accurate forecasting, thanks to machine learning, could help ensure retailers please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time.

Current subjective forecasting methods for retail have little data to back them up and are unlikely to be automated. The problem becomes even more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever-transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing.

Objectives:
1. Provide suggestions for Corporación Favorita management based on historical sales data
2. Forecast store sales by building a model to predict unit sales for each item sold at different stores

Data that are currently being used here is data from Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, that was obtained from an open-source Kaggle. There are six datas in the store-sales-time-series-forecasting.zip, such as:
1. train.csv
2. test.csv
3. stores.csv
4. oil.csv
5. holiday_events.csv
6. transactions.csv

Conclusion:
1. Increase in sales every December because of the Christmas and New Year holidays.
2. The fewest sales occur on Thursday and increase until Sunday.
3. Sales during holidays are higher than non-holidays.
4. Top sales in Quito city and dominated by grocery and beverages.

Recommendation for supermarket management:
1. Holiday inventory management
2. Data-driven decision making
3. Loyalty programs and customer engagement
4. Seasonal promotions
5. Weekend focus
6. Strategic location marketing
7. Product category expansion

The output of the data modeling is a prediction result for each future transaction with mean absolute error (MAE) 499,09.
